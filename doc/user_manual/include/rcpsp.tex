\section{Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)}
\label{sec:RCPSP}

In this section, we consider the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP).
In RCPSP, the activities of a project have to be scheduled such that the makespan of the
project is minimized. Thereby, technological precedence constraints have to be observed
as well as limited capacities of the renewable resources that are required to accomplish
the activities. The RCPSP for the scheduling of maintenance and surveillance activities
of nuclear power plant can be summarized as follows:

We consider a project that consists of a set of $J$ jobs (or tasks). Due to technological
requirements, precedence relations among some of the jobs enforce that job $j=2,3,\cdots,J$
may not be started before all its predecessors, denoted by $P_j$, are finished. Here,
$j=1$ indexes an artificial job with zero duration, which precedes all jobs that can
start at time zero, and  $j=J$ indexes an artificial final job, again with zero duration,
which represents the end of the project. Executing job $j$ takes $d_j$ time periods and
is supported by a set, $R$, of renewable resources. Consider a horizon with an upper
bound, $T$, on the project's makespan, i.e., the time at which the final job
is completed. We assume $K_{r}^{p}$ units of renewable resource $r\in R$, are available
in time period $t=1,2,\cdots,T$. Job $j$ requires $k_{jr}^{p}$  units of the renewable
resource, $r\in R$, for each period of the job’s duration, i.e., for time periods
when the job is in process.

The objective is to find a schedule which minimizes the project’s makespan while
respecting the constraints imposed by the precedence relations and the limited
resource availability.
